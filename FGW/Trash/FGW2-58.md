# QUESTIONS


1. What fields are needed in FGW
2. seating basically not used in SW (time is what matters) - do we need extra validation for that?


1. Table reservation
2. buffe or breakfast
3. Addon with the dining ()



**REMEMBER**
- Price SUM (why TotalCost 0)
- when restaurant key & time same, merge to one dining with multiple guests

- DEV and TEST difference making


# TODO
- Quantity ✅
- Correct TotalCost ✅
- Availability service ✅
- Adding different meals to multiple passengers ✅
- ReturnSail meals ✅
- OperatorAdded
- Meal Under Different Sail is accepted
- Tests
